# Predicting a Vehicle's Fuel Efficiecny

For a project in my Operations Research class, I predicted 300 cars' fuel efficiency (in mpg). The goal of the project was to minimize the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 

I was given a spreadsheet that contained a training dataset and a testing dataset. I built a machine learning model using the training set, which was further split into a training/validation set. The MAPE of this model was around 6.1%. I then applied the model to make predictions on the testing set. My final results achieved a MAPE of 6.7%, which was among the best scores ever achieved in the 10-year history of this Operations Research class at LSU.
